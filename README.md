# ANN_Churn_Modelling
## Understand About Data & Problem
The dataset have basically 13 features. Here the independent features are Gender, Age, Tenure, No. of Products and etc. and the dependent feature is the Exited. So we need to predict the customer in the bank who will Exited or not in the future. This Churn modelling can play an important rule in the bank. Because bank wouldn't want to exit his existing customer. If the bank can predict about the customer is leaving so they will provide some better product to stay the cutomer. its about the loyal factor.
